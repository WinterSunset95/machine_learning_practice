# Notes I took from my course

* mean - the average
* median - the middle value
* mode - the value which appears most frequently
  
<br>    numpy.mean()
<br>    numpy.median()
<br>    numpy.mode()

* standard deviation - how spread out the values are
<br>    numpy.std()

* variance - square of standard variation:
<br>	a) Find the mean
<br>	b) For each value, find the difference from the mean.
<br>	c) For each difference, find the square 
<br>	d) Variance is the average of those squares
<br><br>    OR
<br>	numpy.var()
