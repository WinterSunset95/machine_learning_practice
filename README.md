# Notes I took from my course

* mean - the average
* median - the middle value
* mode - the value which appears most frequently
<br>    numpy.mean()
<br>    numpy.median()
<br>    numpy.mode()

* standard deviation - how spread out the values are
<br>    numpy.std()

* variance - square of standard variation:
<br>	a) Find the mean
<br>	b) For each value, find the difference from the mean.
<br>	c) For each difference, find the square 
<br>	d) Variance is the average of those squares
<br>    OR
<br>	numpy.var()

* percentile - number that describes the value that a given percent of values are lower than.
<br>	eg.
<code>
  ages = [5,31,43,48,50,41,7,11,15,39,80,82,32,2,8,6,25,36,27,61,31]
